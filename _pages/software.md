CircDBG
------
**_CircDBG_** is developed by _C++_. It uses a special designed de Bruijn graph for circular RNA detection. For more details, please refer to [https://github.com/lxwgcool/CircDBG](https://github.com/lxwgcool/CircDBG).


CircMarker
------
**_CircMarker_** is developed by _C++_. It finds circular RNA based on k-mers rather than reads mapping. For more details, please refer to [https://github.com/lxwgcool/CircMarker](https://github.com/lxwgcool/CircMarker).
